i want to continue working on the website, can we do that in a new conversation?
2:21 PM

Sure! Just start a new conversation and paste in your website code (or describe what you're working on), and we can pick right up from there. I don't have memory of previous conversations, so sharing the relevant context will help us get started quickly.

Got it! I can see Mandy's portfolio site — it looks great. It has the main sections (About, Technical Writing, Photography, AI Ethics, Contact) with placeholder content ready to be filled in.

What would you like to work on today? For example:

    Filling in the project titles and descriptions in the Technical Writing section
    Adding real photos to the Photography section
    Updating the AI Ethics essays
    Tweaking the design or layout
    Something else entirely

I want to work on preparing the samples that I already have, but also we added the photos last night, we just need to finish the site
2:24 PM

It sounds like there are a few things to tackle! Let me ask a couple questions to get us organized:

Also — can you share the actual HTML/CSS files for the site? Since I can't see the version we built together yesterday (just what's currently live), having the source code will make it much easier to make accurate edits without accidentally undoing anything.
2:24 PM

Great, I've got the full source code! The site is looking really solid. Here's what I can see still needs real content:

Technical Writing section — all 6 cards are placeholder text (titles, descriptions, and links)

AI Ethics section — the featured essay and all 4 article rows are placeholder text

Contact section — the résumé PDF link is dead (href="#")

The photography section looks done with real images, and the about/bio is fully written.

So — what are the samples you want to work on preparing? You can share them here (paste text, upload files, or describe what you have) and we can figure out how to best present them on the site. What do you have?

https://github.com/mandyhathaway/ImageGeneratorforStudents  there are two diffrent pieces of curriculm here, each has 2 parts, I want to decide which or both to use, and then I need to reformat to remove all elements of my empoyer from the document formatting etc
2:26 PM

Great — I can see both pieces of curriculum clearly now. Let me make sure I understand what you have:

Piece 1 — "Build an Image Generation Model" (the PyTorch/StableDiffusion lesson)

    Part A: The instructor guide/lesson plan PDF
    Part B: The GitHub repo with the actual notebook → https://github.com/mandyhathaway/ImageGeneratorforStudents

Piece 2 — "Probabilities and Confidence"

    Part A: The student-facing slideshow PDF
    Part B: The instructor guide PDF

Before we reformat anything, a couple of questions to make sure we do this right:

Also — one important thing to flag: these documents are marked CONFIDENTIAL and are © Coding with Kids. Before we reformat and republish them, I want to make sure you have the right to do that. Do you own the content, or did you create it as part of your work there? That will affect how we proceed — for example, whether you can publish the full curriculum or just reference/describe your role in creating it.

I created them and they are my property, I just formatted them to be used by the company that I am leaving. There is no contract giving them ownership over my work.
2:27 PM

Got it, that's clear. Let's get started then. Let me check the GitHub repo too so I know what we're working with there.

Good — the GitHub repo has exactly what we need: a clean notebook with notes, a student template version, and a Python file. That's a strong portfolio piece.

Here's my plan for both pieces of curriculum. I'll:

    Reformat the PDFs — strip all Coding with Kids branding, logos, confidentiality headers, and copyright footers, and reformat them under your name
    Update the website cards with real titles, descriptions, and links

Before I start generating PDFs, let me ask one more practical thing — do you want your name/branding on the reformatted docs, or just clean/neutral formatting with no company branding at all?

Understood — let me start on the PDFs with your name/branding. I'll read the PDF skill first to make sure I do this right.

I'm not sure, what will look most professional? also we need to change the orange colors, that is also a coding with kids element
2:28 PM

For a professional portfolio, I'd recommend your name + © Mandy Hathaway in the header, with clean neutral formatting — no color accents at all, or swapped to the green from your website. That way it looks like polished original work, not a company document with the logo stripped out.

Here's my recommendation for the reformatted docs:

    Header: "Mandy Hathaway" in a clean serif font, with the lesson title below it
    Color: swap all orange to your site's green (#5a7a3a) or just go fully black/gray for maximum neutrality
    Remove: CONFIDENTIAL banners, CWK logo, copyright footer, "Coding with Kids >" pathway breadcrumb
    Replace footer with: © 2025 Mandy Hathaway or just omit it entirely

I'd lean toward using your site's green — it'll make the docs feel like they belong to your brand, which is exactly what a portfolio should do.

Want me to start with the instructor guide for "Build an Image Generation Model" first? That one has the clearest structure and will let us establish the template, then we apply the same treatment to the Probabilities & Confidence docs. Sound good?

Read the full script to proofread

I spotted a few things worth fixing:

    Line 261 — "The environment will reconnect, you are now using..." — that comma creates a comma splice. Should be a period or "and you are now using."
    Line 249 — "the same kind of parallel math, multiplying enormous matrices" — the comma after "math" is a bit awkward. Should be a colon or "specifically, multiplying."
    Lines 281-308 — The step titles use commas ("Step 1, Import libraries") where they should use colons ("Step 1: Import libraries") to match the phase heading style.
    Line 325 — "Experiment using a self-built image generation model" is a bit clunky. "Experiment with a self-built image generation model" reads better.
    Line 407 — "in a named function that Gradio can call each time a user submits a prompt" — missing a period at the end of that sentence before the colon.

Viewed a file, created a file, ran a command
Done

Take a look! The structure follows the same template as the image generation doc — matching branding, green accents, your name and footer — but it's adapted for a conceptual lesson rather than a technical one. A few things I did specifically for this doc:

    Added a light green callout box style for key distinctions and instructor notes, since this lesson has more "stop and emphasize this" moments
    The bonus challenge (the pens probability problem) is in a callout box so it reads as a sidebar activity
    The key distinction between probability and confidence is called out clearly, since that's the conceptual heart of the lesson
    The Teachable Machine walkthrough uses the same numbered step format as the image generation doc for consistency
    No dashes anywhere

am i missing anything i should include to make the discussion clear and correct?
2:47 PM

Let me read through the full content carefully with fresh eyes, specifically looking at the conceptual accuracy and completeness of the discussion.
Read the full Probabilities and Confidence script
Done

The content is solid and accurate. Here are the things I think are genuinely missing or could be more complete:

Conceptually:

    The key distinction callout is slightly imprecise. It says "A model can make a high-probability prediction with low confidence if the input is ambiguous." In practice, in most classification models like Teachable Machine, confidence scores are the output probabilities — they are the same number. The distinction is more accurately that high confidence doesn't mean the model is actually correct, especially if the input looks nothing like the training data. This is worth clarifying so you aren't accidentally teaching something misleading.
    Training data is mentioned as a discussion question but never actually explained. You ask "what would happen if a model was trained on bad data?" but never give instructors the answer or the vocabulary. A brief note on the concept of "garbage in, garbage out" and how training data quality directly determines what probabilities the model learns would make that question much more productive in the classroom.
    There is no explanation of what "training" actually is. Students build a Teachable Machine model in Phase 4 but the document never explains what is happening during the training step. Even one sentence connecting training to the probability concept would tie the lesson together more tightly.
    The overview bullet points still have em dashes in them (lines 130-134). Small thing but worth fixing for consistency.

Want me to go ahead and add all four of these fixes?

Ran 3 commands, read a file
Done

Take a look! Here is what changed:

The confidence callout is now technically accurate — it explains that in models like Teachable Machine the confidence score and probability are actually the same number, and reframes the key lesson as "high confidence does not mean correct," which is more useful and honest.

The training data section gives instructors the vocabulary and a concrete example (red vs. green apples) to actually answer the biased data discussion question they were asking students, instead of leaving it hanging.

The "What Happens During Training" section in Phase 4 connects the training step students are about to do back to the probability concepts from Phase 2, so the hands-on activity feels like a demonstration of what they just learned rather than a separate thing.

Let me know what you think, and whether anything reads awkwardly!

The borderPadding in ReportLab doesn't actually add internal padding to the text the way you'd expect — it affects the border drawing, not the text flow. Let me fix this properly by wrapping the callout content in a single-cell table instead, which gives us real control over padding.

Good read. I found a few things:

    Line 255 — "when an image classifier identifies an object in a photo — all of these are the model" — there's still an em dash in there that we missed.
    Line 319-322 — The "Reading Confidence Scores" bullets also have two em dashes: "barely leaning one way" and "completely certain." Those should be cleaned up too.
    Line 183 — "Two of the most important concepts are ones students have likely already encountered in math class: probability and confidence." Confidence isn't typically a math class concept the way probability is — students learn probability in math, but confidence as an AI concept is new. The sentence would be more accurate as something like "probability and, as we will see, confidence."
    Line 272 — "ones, not because of a flaw in the math, but because it never saw them." The comma after "ones" makes this a comma splice. Should be a period or restructured: "not because of a flaw in the math, but simply because the model had never seen one."

Let me fix all four:
Ran 2 commands, read a file
Done

All five fixes landed. Here is what changed:

    The em dashes in "Connecting Probability to AI" and both "Reading Confidence Scores" bullets are gone
    The claim that students encounter confidence in math class is corrected — the sentence now accurately says they know probability from math, and frames confidence as a related new concept
    The comma splice in the garbage in/garbage out paragraph is fixed and now reads more clearly as three distinct sentences

do you think i should use both pieces on the website?
2:56 PM

Yes, I think you should use both, and here's why: they demonstrate two very different but equally important skills.

The Image Generation Model doc shows you can take complex technical material — PyTorch, GPU configuration, Stable Diffusion pipelines — and make it accessible and teachable. That speaks to your AI/ML engineering side.

The Probabilities and Confidence doc shows something harder to find: that you can take abstract mathematical concepts and build a coherent pedagogical arc around them, with discussion questions, worked examples, a callout for instructor notes, and a hands-on activity that ties it all together. That speaks to your instructional design and curriculum thinking side.

Together they cover the full range of what you're selling on this site — technical depth AND the ability to teach and communicate. Showing only one would leave a gap. Someone hiring for technical writing or instructional design will want to see both; someone hiring for AI/ML will be impressed that you can also build curriculum around it.

The one thing I'd think about is how you label them on the site. Right now the writing section has six placeholder cards. I'd suggest:

    Label one as Curriculum Design (Probabilities and Confidence)
    Label one as Instructional Design (Image Generation Model)
    And link both to their PDFs, with the Image Generation one also linking to the GitHub repo

That way they fill two different card slots and tell a more complete story about your range. Want me to go ahead and update the website cards now?

should we also put together the presentation that goes with probabilities and confidence?
2:57 PM

Yes, absolutely. The presentation is the student-facing piece that goes with the instructor guide, so having both makes the portfolio entry much stronger — it shows you designed the whole lesson, not just one component.

Looking at what we have from the original slideshow PDF, it's a pretty complete deck already. The content is all there, it just needs the same treatment as the other docs: strip the CWK branding and orange, bring in your green and clean typography.

Before I start building it though, a few quick questions:

Good choices — a .pptx that's actually usable is much more impressive as a portfolio piece, and trimming to keep it clean makes sense since the instructor guide carries all the detail. Let me read the PPTX skill first before I start building.

Good visual review complete. Issues I spotted:

    Slide 1 — "and Confidence" is overlapping the subtitle. The title text boxes need height adjustments.
    Slide 7 — The bottom italic tagline has an em dash that slipped through.
    Slide 8 — "Total uncertainty" label is cut off as "ncertainty." The marker text box is too narrow.
    Slide 9 — The "vs" circle is floating awkwardly in the middle between the two columns and the two columns have too much empty space below the text.
    Slide 10 — The layout is slightly uneven, steps 4 and 5 look cramped in the right column vs. the left having more vertical space.

Let me fix all of these:

Slide 8 still has "uncertainty" cut off on the left. The label is starting too far left relative to the slide edge. Also both example description labels still have em dashes. Let me fix those and check slide 9:

Slide 9 still has dead space below and an em dash in the callout, and slide 8's "Total uncertainty" label is still clipped. Let me fix all remaining issues at once:

Slides 8 and 9 are looking much better — labels are readable, em dashes are gone. Slide 9 still has dead space below the two columns before the callout. The "vs" circle is also overlapping the text in the left column. Let me do one final fix on both of those:
Ran 2 commands, viewed a file
Done

There's still dead space at the bottom of slide 9. The columns are just short. The "vs" circle still clips the left column text slightly too. This is a structural limitation of how pptxgenjs handles overlapping shapes. The cleanest fix is to remove the "vs" circle and just let the column border serve as the divider — it's cleaner anyway:

does this have any typos or AI elements we should fix
3:11 PM

Let me read through the full script carefully.
Viewed 2 files
Done

Good full read. Here's what I found:

Typos / grammar:

    Slide 4, line 256 — "divide the fraction" as a caption for 0.5 is slightly off. You divide the numerator by the denominator — not the fraction itself. Better phrasing: "numerator ÷ denominator."
    Slide 7, line 510 — "AI is not guessing. It is doing sophisticated probability calculations at enormous scale." Two short declarative sentences back to back reads a little choppy for a closing tagline. Flows better as: "AI is not guessing randomly. It is doing sophisticated math at enormous scale."

AI-sounding elements: 3. Slide 3, line 186 — "Every AI model, no matter what it does, relies on the same underlying mathematics." The phrase "underlying mathematics" is a very common AI-writing tell. Something like "runs on the same core math" or "is built on the same foundation" sounds more like a teacher talking to students. 4. Slide 12, line 807 — "Garbage in, garbage out. The model can only be as good as what it learned from." The second sentence is redundant — "garbage in, garbage out" already says this. Drop the second sentence, it'll land harder on its own. 5. Slide 9, line 675 — "because it can only compare the input to what it already knows" — slightly passive and wordy. "It can only work with what it was trained on" is cleaner.

    Slide 7 — "AI is not guessing. It is doing sophisticated probability calculations at enormous scale." → "AI is not guessing randomly. It is doing sophisticated math at enormous scale."
    Slide 9 — "it can only compare the input to what it already knows" → "It can only work with what it was trained on"
    Slide 12 — dropped the redundant second sentence after "Garbage in, garbage out."

The only em dash left in the file is in a code comment on line 10 (// deep green — dominant), which is invisible in the final presentation.

Presentation · PPTX 

what is the best way to present the whole probablities and confidence project in the portfolio?
3:22 PM

You now have three pieces:

    The instructor guide (PDF) — the teacher-facing document with lesson structure, pedagogical notes, worked examples, the GIGO section
    The presentation (PPTX) — the student-facing slideshow, 12 slides
    The original slideshow — you could argue this is redundant with the PPTX now

The core question is what story you want the portfolio entry to tell. A few options:

Option A: Show the full lesson package Link both the instructor guide PDF and the PPTX together as a single portfolio entry labeled something like "Lesson Package: Probabilities and Confidence." This frames you as someone who designed a complete, coherent unit — not just a document. The viewer gets the teacher view and the student view in one click. This is the strongest option if your goal is curriculum design roles.

Option B: Lead with the presentation, link the guide as a supplement Make the PPTX the hero since it's the most visually impressive artifact, and offer the instructor guide as a "download the full lesson plan" link underneath. This works better for a portfolio where visual impact matters and viewers might not read deeply.

Option C: Separate entries List them as two distinct portfolio cards — one for instructional design (the guide), one for curriculum development (the deck). This makes the portfolio look more populated but can feel padded if the viewer realizes they're two parts of the same lesson.

My recommendation is Option A, framed clearly. Something like:

    Probabilities and Confidence — Complete Lesson Package A K–12 AI lesson connecting probability math to machine learning confidence scores, built around hands-on practice with Google's Teachable Machine. Includes instructor guide and student-facing presentation. [Instructor Guide ↓] [Presentation ↓]

That description does real work — it tells the reader the subject, the age range, the pedagogical hook, and the real-world tool. Anyone hiring for curriculum or instructional design roles will immediately understand the scope.

One thing worth thinking about: do you want to show the original CWK version alongside the reformatted one to demonstrate the before/after? That could be compelling evidence of your editorial judgment — "here's what I built, here's how I'd present it independently." But it also risks drawing attention to the employer relationship, so probably not worth it unless you're applying somewhere that specifically values that kind of reflection.

Probabilities and Confidence is full-width with a two-column layout — card description on the left, and a "Downloads" panel on the right with two distinct links (Instructor Guide PDF and Student Presentation PPTX). This makes it immediately clear it's a complete package, not just a single file.

Build an Image Generation Model is a standard card with two separate links — one for the PDF and one for the GitHub repo — since those are genuinely different things.

The placeholder cards are visually dimmed so they read as "coming soon" without being jarring.

A couple of things to decide before we put this on the live site: do you want the PDFs and PPTX actually hosted somewhere (like directly on the site, or via a Google Drive / Dropbox link), or are you handling hosting separately? That'll determine what the href values should be.

      <p>I'm Mandy Hathaway — a programmer, AI specialist, and technical writer with over 30 years of hands-on experience in technology. I hold an MA in Ethical Technology &amp; Artificial Intelligence and a BA in Philosophy from Metropolitan State University. I build and fine-tune AI and LLM systems, work across the ML stack from data preprocessing to model deployment, and spend my own time on 3D modeling, printing, and pushing language models to their limits. I translate that depth into writing and curriculum that actually sticks.</p>
      <p>At Coding With Kids I've taught hundreds of students — from Scratch to Python to machine learning — while leading a team of 30 instructors. My editorial work comes from my time as Technology Editor at <em>The Metropolitan</em>. I'm drawn to hard problems and thrive in roles that sit at the intersection of technical complexity and clear communication.</p>
      <p>I'm available for remote roles in AI/ML, technical writing, instructional design, prompt engineering, and AI ethics — as well as freelance and contract work.</p>

Got the full source. Now I'll update the two curriculum cards and produce the complete updated HTML.
Ran 3 commands, read a file
Done

This is the full updated index.html — the complete site, ready to deploy. The two changes to the writing grid:

Card 1 — Curriculum Design: Probabilities and Confidence Links to samples/Probabilities_and_Confidence_Hathaway.pdf and samples/Probabilities_and_Confidence_Hathaway.pptx

Card 2 — Instructional Design: Build an Image Generation Model Links to samples/Build_an_Image_Generation_Model_Hathaway.pdf and the GitHub repo

The links assume you'll create a samples/ folder on your server and upload the PDFs and PPTX there. Once you do that and replace your live index.html, everything should be live. Do you want me to also export the final PDFs so you have them ready to upload alongside this file?

      <p>I'm Mandy Hathaway — a programmer, AI specialist, and technical writer with over 30 years of hands-on experience in technology. I hold an MA in Ethical Technology &amp; Artificial Intelligence and a BA in Philosophy from Metropolitan State University. I build and fine-tune AI and LLM systems, work across the ML stack from data preprocessing to model deployment, and spend my own time on 3D modeling, printing, and pushing language models to their limits. I translate that depth into writing and curriculum that actually sticks.</p>
      <p>At Coding With Kids I've taught hundreds of students — from Scratch to Python to machine learning — while leading a team of 30 instructors. My editorial work comes from my time as Technology Editor at <em>The Metropolitan</em>. I'm drawn to hard problems and thrive in roles that sit at the intersection of technical complexity and clear communication.</p>
      <p>I'm available for remote roles in AI/ML, technical writing, instructional design, prompt engineering, and AI ethics — as well as freelance and contract work.</p>
